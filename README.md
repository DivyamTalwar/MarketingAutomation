> ### **üìú The Manifesto: The Agency is Dead. Long Live the Swarm.**
> The traditional marketing agency is a relic‚Äîslow, expensive, and bottlenecked by human limitations. **AI Marketing Swarm** is the response. It is a decentralized, autonomous content engine built on `n8n` that operationalizes a world-class marketing team as a set of interconnected, intelligent workflows. It doesn't just assist; it conceives, creates, and executes entire multi-channel campaigns‚Äîfrom insightful blog posts and professional LinkedIn updates to compelling, AI-generated videos with custom sound. We are not augmenting the marketing team. We are replacing it with a more efficient, scalable, and creative digital organism.

### **üß† The Digital Agency: Architecture & Blueprints**
AI Marketing Swarm is a collection of specialized, expert workflows orchestrated by `n8n`. Each workflow is a "specialist" in our digital agency, designed to perform a specific marketing function with peak efficiency. This modular architecture allows for infinite scalability and easy customization.

<details>
<summary><strong>üèõÔ∏è Click to Meet the Marketing Task Force: The Specialist Workflows</strong></summary>

#### **Workflow Spotlight: The Anatomy of a Blog Post**
This is not just JSON; it's a repeatable blueprint for perfect content. Here‚Äôs a glimpse into the "mind" of our Blog Post specialist, showcasing the sophisticated prompting that drives its output.

```json
// Blog_Post.json (Illustrative Snippet from an n8n Agent)
{
  "name": "Blog Post Agent",
  "type": "n8n-nodes-base.agent",
  "typeVersion": 1,
  "position": [1080, 520],
  "parameters": {
    "model": "gemini",
    "systemMessage": "You are a world-class SEO Content Writer and Marketing Expert. Your task is to write a comprehensive, engaging, and insightful blog post on the given topic. The tone should be authoritative yet accessible. Structure the article with clear headings, bullet points, and a compelling introduction and conclusion. Ensure the content is optimized for search engines by naturally including relevant keywords. You MUST generate a suitable, creative prompt for an AI image generator to create a header image for this blog post. Your final output must be a single JSON object containing two keys: 'blog_post' and 'image_prompt'."
  }
}

---

### **üõ†Ô∏è Activation Protocol: Setup & Deployment**

#### 1. **Set Up the Hive (n8n)**
- **Option A (Cloud):** Sign up for a free `n8n` cloud instance [here](https://n8n.io/pricing/).
- **Option B (Self-Host):** Deploy `n8n` using Docker.
  ```bash
  docker run -it --rm --name n8n -p 5678:5678 -v ~/.n8n:/home/node/.n8n n8nio/n8n
  ```

#### 2. **Clone the DNA**
Clone this repository to get all the workflow `.json` files.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DivyamTalwar/Sarvam.ai-Assignment.git
cd Sarvam.ai-Assignment
```

#### 3. **Import the Specialists**
In your n8n canvas, manually import each `.json` file from this repository. This will load the pre-built workflows into your instance.

#### 4. **Arm the System: Configure Credentials**
This is the most critical step. In your n8n instance, go to the "Credentials" section and add new credentials for each of the following services. The workflows will automatically use them.

- **Google AI:** For Gemini models.
- **OpenAI:** For DALL-E models.
- **Runway:** For your Runway API key.
- **ElevenLabs:** For your ElevenLabs API key.
- **News API:** For the `Get_News.json` workflow.

#### 5. **Execute**
Navigate to a workflow (e.g., `Blog_Post`) and hit "Execute Workflow". Provide a topic and watch the Swarm create. You can also activate workflows to run on schedules or via webhooks for full automation.
